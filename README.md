## GITSPACE:

GitSpace is a space for you to reflect on your day, how you feel, jot down reminders and the goals you have for the day. On GitSpace, you can update your goals if you complete them, you can delete your reminders, and see how you've been feeling throughout the day as way to remind yourself that feelings are temporary and everything will pass!

## Technologies used: 

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js

## Getting Started:

Log in with Google through Google OAuth here: https://sei-gitspace.herokuapp.com/

## Next Steps: 

Future steps include being able to delete and update every entry the user inputs. Another future step is a form where users will be able to input their meals throughout the day to keep track of their physical health. This will be done by implementing Nutritionix API - an api of nutritio data.
